/*
Package card implements functionality to add, remove, charge, and issue refunds for credit cards
as well as view reports for lists of charges and refunds.

Charges are performed via Stripe. This package requires loading the Stripe private key for your
Stripe account when the app starts.  The private key should be in the app.yaml file as an
environmental variable.

When a card is added to the app, very minimal (expiration and last 4) of the card's data
is actually stored in App Engine. The card's information is sent to Stripe who then
returns an id for this card. When a charge is processed, this id is sent to Stripe and
Stripe looks up the card's information to charge it. The information stored in App Engine
is safe, as in if someone were to get the data, it could not be used to process charges.
No credit card number is stored.  The data is just used to identify the card so users of
the app know which card they are charging.

Datastore ID: the ID of the entity (think sql "row") in the App Engine Datastore.
Customer ID: the ID that the user provides that links the card to a company.  This is usually from a CRM software.
Stripe ID: the ID stripe uses to process a charge.  Also known as the stripe customer token.
For each datastore ID, there should be one and only one customer ID and stripe ID.
For each customer ID, there can be many datastore IDs and stripe IDs; one for each card added.
For each stripe ID, there should be one and only one datastore ID and customer ID.
