/*
Package output is used to send data back to client in a consistent manner.

Sending data back to client using these funcs allows the data to be easily parsable by
the client since the format is always the same. The data send back is always sent
back as JSON.

Responses can either be successful or error. Each has specific uses and returns
data slightly differently.
