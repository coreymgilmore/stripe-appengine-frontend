V2.1.0
-------------
- reorganized all file per App Engine best practices.
    - organized into "project and services" style.
    - see https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/standard/go/an-overview-of-app-engine
    - and https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/standard/go/runtime

- now using Google Cloud SDK to develop and deploy
    - no longer using "goapp serve" and "goapp deploy"
    - this results in no longer needing the "application" or "version" lines in app.yaml.

- renamed "transfers" to "payouts" in the reports
    - per changes in stripe.



V2.0.1
-------------
- renamed version V2 to V2.0.0

- add some better logging
    - try to see if Stripe passes back any more useful information when a card is not accepted or declined
        - so we can present more useful information in the GUI rather than just "card was declined"
    - to better understand some edge case errors
    - secure the cron task that removes expired cards

- fix bug where report was not showing who processed a charge or refund

V2.0.0
-------------

- use init() function to initialize packages instead of calling another function (i.e. package.Init())
    - this clean up code
    - makes code more "golang" styled
    - remove "initialization" from app.go's init() func.

- store config stuff in environmental variables in app.yaml
    - **this is a breaking change**
    - remove need for creating txt files for session keys, stripe key, and statement descriptor.
    - uses standard appengine abilities instead of having to read from files
    - cleans up code base

- clean up code everywhere
    - better documentation
    - better styling and formatting

- remove some external dependencies and include them as local packages instead
    - less dependencies

- add "charge and remove" feature
    - allows users to charge and remove a card all in one step
    - used for one-time cards or times when a customer only wants to use a card once
    - just removes need for choosing "charge" then "remove"

- automatially remove expired card
    - a cron task runs on the first of the month and removes any card that has expired
