    - doesn't require editting app.yaml and republishing app.

- implement app settings.
    - similar to company settings, but for stuff that influences the app.
    - example: requiring customer id when adding a card.  Used to have to do this via change in HTML code.

- show alerts if company info and statement descriptor aren't set.

- now using Google Cloud SDK to develop and deploy
    - no longer using "goapp serve" and "goapp deploy"

    - remove "initialization" from app.go's init() func.

- store config stuff in environmental variables in app.yaml
    - **this is a breaking change**
    - remove need for creating txt files for session keys, stripe key, and statement descriptor.
    - uses standard appengine abilities instead of having to read from files
    - cleans up code base

    - just removes need for choosing "charge" then "remove"

- automatially remove expired card
    - a cron task runs on the first of the month and removes any card that has expired
