    - use flag to set this (--use-sqlite) which then looks up path to sqlite.db from app.yaml
        - reuse app.yaml to get environmental variables instead of having to create a separate .conf (config) file
    - have to switch between sqlite/datastore as needed in code
    - try to keep sample table structure in sqlite as datastore
    - have to create a golang-sqlite-datastore abstraction layer
        - try to keep most of the code the same as datastore package funcs just with a connection to sqlite
    - instead of having to maintain two versions of this app: google appengine based and local server based
