auth charge instead of capturing
    - to make sure a card has funds but we don't want to charge the card yet
    - make this a drop down option in the charge card panel
    - display the charge as "pending" in charge report.  don't add it to the total charged or # of charges
        - don't show receipt button
        - don't show refund button
        - show a "capture" button that will result in the charge being captured.
            - not sure if this results in a charge being captured for the day it was authed on or the day it was captured on
    - set metadata about "pending charge captured", "authed date", "charged date", "authed by", and "charged by"

set use of redis as memcache in environmental variable
    - maybe?
    - would require a lot of if/else for checking cache and setting stuff
    - would this add latency since we would be making HTTP requests to look up stuff in cache?  probably.

rename project to "stripe-frontend"
    - since we offer a non-appengine install
    - more descriptive by not including appengine
    - need to fix import paths for golang

rewrite using typescript and vue?
