set use of redis as memcache in environmental variable
    - maybe?
    - would require a lot of if/else for checking cache and setting stuff
    - would this add latency since we would be making HTTP requests to look up stuff in cache?  probably.

rename project to "stripe-frontend"
    - since we offer a non-appengine install
    - more descriptive by not including appengine
    - need to fix import paths for golang

rewrite using typescript and vue?
