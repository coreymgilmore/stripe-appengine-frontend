set use of redis as memcache in environmental variable
    - maybe?
    - would require a lot of if/else for checking cache and setting stuff
    - would this add latency since we would be making HTTP requests to look up stuff in cache?  probably.

better step-by-step document of how to install/set up

rename project to "stripe-frontend"
    - since we offer a non-appengine install
    - more descriptive by not including appengine
    - need to fix import paths for golang

sqlite/local install instead of appengine
    - allow using sqlite instead of appengine datastore
    - use flag to set this (--deploymentType=sqlite) which then looks up path to sqlite.db from app.yaml
        - reuse app.yaml to get environmental variables instead of having to create a separate .conf (config) file
    - have to switch between sqlite/datastore as needed in code
    - try to keep sample table structure in sqlite the same as datastore
    - redo and functionize any "get" or "set" db related queries so they are more easily maintained.
    - need to and "ID" field to structs
        - make sure this doesn't overlap with datastore key ids

rewrite using typescript and vue?
