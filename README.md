#A Frontend for Stripe Hosted on App Engine

####Intro:

This app is basically a "virtual terminal" for collection and charging credit cards.  This is meant to be used for businesses that collect credit cards from customers and then charge this card repeadly for orders.  It removes the need to ask for card information at every purchase, stops you from storing credit cards in your database or on paper, and does not require PCI compliance since you are not storing any data about the cards.

All processing and storing of credit card data is done via Stripe (https://stripe.com).  Since this uses Stripe you get the benefits of vastly easier to understand pricing, a modern administrative interface, and the ability to store cards without needing PCI compliance or worrying about someone hacking your database.

When you install this app, you deploy it to Google App Engine. The app lives "in the cloud" so your employees can access it from anywhere.  This also reduces complexity and the needs for IT personel.

####What can you do with this app?:
1. Add credit cards to charge now or in the future.
2. Remove cards that already exist.
3. Charge credit cards (and refund charges).
4. View transaction reports.
5. Add or remove user's as needed.
6. Control users' permissions to add, remove, or charge cards, and view reports.
7. Block a user.
8. Set your own Statement Descriptor so your customers recognize your charge.
9. Print receipts.
10. Make API-style requests to autofill the card, amount, invoice, and purchase order.

####Who should use this app?:
- Any company who processes credit cards via a virtual terminal.

####Benefits over other virtual terminals:
- Does not require PCI compliance.
- No storing of credit card information on your servers.
- Simple, clean, easy to use, and modern interface.
- You control the user's and access rights.
- Simple pricing via Stripe.
- Very quick deposits to your bank acount. As short as 1-day.

####How it works:
1. You create a new customer by providing the customer's name and card information.
2. The card data is saved to Stripe and an ID is saved to the app.
3. When you want to charge a card, the ID is used to send the charge to Stripe.
4. Stripe looks up the credit card's information and processes the charge.
5. If the charge is successful, a receipt is shown.  If the card was declined, an error is shown.

####Install & Setup:
1. Create a Stripe account.
2. Activate your Stripe account.
3. Create a Google Account.
4. Create an App Engine project.
5. Download this app's source code.
6. Configure the app.
7. Deploy to App Engine.
8. Done!

####Pricing:
There are two pricing considerations for this app. Stripe, and Google App Engine.
1. Pricing for credit card processing is given by Stripe.  Please visit this link: https://stripe.com/us/pricing. The charges are removed from your balance before it is ACH-ed to your bank account.  Any payment processor will charge processing fees.
2. You *may* have to pay for Google App Engine if you use this app heavily. App Engine has a free tier that allows for a set limit to daily usage. Once these limits hit, your app will either stop functioning or you will be billed. Please see this link for details on pricing: https://cloud.google.com/appengine/pricing.
